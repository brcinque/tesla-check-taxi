## **RED FLAG SCORECARD (Your Exit Trigger Framework)**

Assign points for each occurrence, consider exiting if you hit 10+ points in 12 months:

- **NHTSA opens formal investigation into FSD:** 3 points
- **Fatal accident where FSD was engaged and at fault:** 5 points
- **Major regulatory approval denied (California, Texas):** 4 points
- **Musk pushes robotaxi timeline back >1 year:** 2 points
- **Waymo expands to 10+ cities while Tesla stuck at <3:** 3 points
- **Peer-reviewed study shows Tesla less safe than human drivers:** 5 points
- **Class action lawsuit wins major ruling against Tesla:** 3 points
- **FSD version numbers stagnate for 6+ months:** 2 points
- **Key AI/Autopilot executives leave Tesla:** 3 points each
- **Tesla drops below #5 on Guidehouse leaderboard:** 4 points

---

**The Bottom Line:**

You need a mix of:
- **Hard data** (accident rates, regulatory filings, competitive metrics)
- **Expert interpretation** (people who understand the tech, not just cheerleaders)
- **Market signals** (what are people with money on the line actually doing?)

Set up Google Alerts for: "Tesla FSD investigation," "Tesla Autopilot accident," "Waymo expansion," "NHTSA Tesla"

This keeps you informed without requiring full-time monitoring. The key is **having predetermined exit criteria** before you invest, so emotion doesn't override data when things go south.
